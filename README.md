# rKillswitch
**Internet enable switch using route.exe for Windows**
***route.exe stores routes in RAM which are not persistent. A reboot will correct any routing issue caused by this kill switch.***

Current state is no functional. Fork of cmdwhoami was just made.(cmdwhoami code was a fork of LiquidVPN batch file)

This batch project uses route.exe to set static routes that send all traffic to nowhere until specifically routed to leave the network. Goal is no internet exposure of your IP outside of static route you define. Most common use is only allow traffic to VPN server.
